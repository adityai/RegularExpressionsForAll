## Introduction:
##### The 'Regular Expressions for all' project aims to catalog regular expressions cheat sheet(s) and sample code in different programming languages to demonstrate how to use them in code.

## Cheat Sheets
The CheatSheets folder in the project will have one or more CheatSheets (Work-in-progress). We have one there now.

## Code samples
The code samples will be available in the code folder. We plan to create samples for as many popular programming languages as possible.

## Contributions
Anyone is welcome to contribute.
